#### Gathering of personally-identifying nformation
Taptone may collect personally-identifying information such as phone numbers and email addresses from users of the Taptone app. Taptone does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

#### Protection of personally-identifying information
Taptone discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Taptone's behalf or to provide services available at Taptone's webservices, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Taptone's webservices, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Taptone will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Taptone discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Taptone believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Taptone, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Taptone and have supplied your email address, Taptone may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whatâ€™s going on with Taptone and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Taptone takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

#### Business transfers
If Taptone, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Taptone goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Taptone may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

#### Privacy policy changes
Taptone may change its Privacy from time to time. Taptone encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of these services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
