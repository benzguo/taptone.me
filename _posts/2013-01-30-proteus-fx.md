Proteus is an open world exploration game with procedurally generated environments and environment-generated music. Last January, I recorded a Proteus session with the audio routed through a series of effects pedals. I rediscovered the video today, and realized the experience is not unlike Radiohead's recent collaboration with Universal Everything, [Polyfauna](http://www.universaleverything.com/projects/polyfauna/).

.

If you want to get your shoegame on with Proteus, this was my effects chain:

> Proteus > MXR carbon copy > Boss RV-5 > keeley rat > out

If you don't have any effects pedals, you can just route your system audio via [Soundflower](http://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/) to any DAW (Ableton Live, Garage Band, etc.).

Happy shoegaming!
